<h1> About Anime Hub </h1>
       <p>Anime Hub was created to provide honest anime reviews, and news on anything anime or vocaloid related. So you may be asking yourself why Anime Hub? There are plenty of other websites out there like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anichart.net"> anichart.net</a> that have information about my favorite shows! Anime Hub is a growing project that is currently accepting your feedback. You tell us what you want in an anime website and we will try to deliver if it meets our objectives.   </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
            <p> Want a truly immersive anime experience where you can feel like you are a part of your favorite anime? Enjoy anime games? Tired of the old avatar system in  traditional forums? Anime Hub plans to create just that;  a virtual hub for anime enthusiasts and die-hards to read and talk about thier favorite shows. Eventually we would like to make the anime hub into an avatar based game that will allow our users to roam the anime hub in 3d. While we are in our humble beginnings, we believe this to be very possible and will work our best on creating the most immersive experience you could get out of an anime website. For now will we provide you with reviews, news, and information regarding anime and vocaloid. Stay Tuned.   </p>
